The Strahov dormitories are widely considered to be the most economical option for students seeking accommodation in Prague. In addition, one of the standout features of the Strahov dormitories is the swimming pool that's located nearby, which is an attractive bonus for residents who want to stay fit and cool off during hot weather.

To become a resident of the Strahov dormitory, **students** must sign a **rental agreement** with the **head of the block**, who is responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operations of the dormitory. The **head of the block** is the main point of contact for any issues that may arise, and they work hard to ensure that the dormitory is a comfortable and welcoming place for all residents. 

Recently, the Strahov student dormitory faced a bed bug infestation, which caused significant disruption and inconvenience for many residents. The problem was so severe that many rooms had to be repaired, with small holes where the bugs could live being plastered over to prevent further infestations. 

Apart from the **head of the block**, another key member of the Strahov dormitory staff is the porter, who serves as a valuable resource for residents seeking assistance with various issues. The porter is responsible for managing the front desk of the dormitory, answering questions and providing guidance to residents, and coordinating a range of **services** such as key lending for sports facilities, laundry room access. The porter is often the first point of contact for residents seeking assistance with issues such as noise complaints, emergency repairs, or other problems, and they work closely with other **staff members** to ensure that the needs of all residents are met.

In addition to the **head of the block** and the **porter**, the Strahov dormitory also employs a team of **handymen** and cleaning staff to keep the complex running smoothly. The **handymen** are responsible for carrying out repairs and maintenance work as needed, such as fixing broken appliances, repairing plumbing or electrical issues, or making general repairs to the dormitory rooms and common areas. The cleaning staff work tirelessly to ensure that the entire complex is kept clean and tidy, performing a range of tasks such as sweeping and mopping floors, wiping down surfaces, emptying garbage cans, and restocking supplies as needed.
